# Activity-Tracker

Overview

This project is a simple system for analyzing activity tracking data using the MapReduce framework. 
The system consists of a mobile frontend application for recording activity and a backend system which handles the analysis of the data. 
The system allows users to maintain a personal profile, where they can add their activities, 
which can then be analyzed through the application and compared with other users in similar activities. 
Users can also see their overall statistics, such as the number of activities, total distance, total exercise time, etc.
